GCP comes with the following grammar topics (pulled from Matlab grammar)

    PR_PLAIN: plain text
    PR_STRING: string literals
    PR_KEYWORD: keywords
    PR_COMMENT: comments
    PR_TYPE: types
    PR_LITERAL: literal values (1, null, true, ..)
    PR_PUNCTUATION: punctuation string
    PR_SOURCE: embedded source
    PR_DECLARATION: markup declaration such as a DOCTYPE
    PR_TAG: sgml tag
    PR_ATTRIB_NAME: sgml attribute name
    PR_ATTRIB_VALUE: sgml attribute value

NB.  Not sure how correct/up-to-date these are?  
     Also Matlab defines PR_CONSTANT & PR_IDENTIFIER.  

Additionally this is what i grepped from prettify.js:

  var PR_STRING = 'str';
  var PR_KEYWORD = 'kwd';
  var PR_COMMENT = 'com';
  var PR_TYPE = 'typ';
  var PR_LITERAL = 'lit';
  var PR_PUNCTUATION = 'pun';
  var PR_PLAIN = 'pln';
  var PR_TAG = 'tag';
  var PR_DECLARATION = 'dec';
  var PR_SOURCE = 'src';
  var PR_ATTRIB_NAME = 'atn';
  var PR_ATTRIB_VALUE = 'atv';
  var PR_NOCODE = 'nocode';


The lang-rebol.js is built from the following files:

  * General grammar is defined in template-lang-rebol.js

  * All defined datatypes in GCP-datatypes.r

  * Most defined keywords (Rebol functions) in GCP-keywords.r


For datatypes:

  * List of datatypes (intially) built from list_datatypes.r

  * In nearly all cases the datatypes were assigned to PR_LITERAL topic.  However there were some exceptions:

      - string!  -  PR_STRING

      - set-word! - PR_DECLARATION


For keywords... 

  * keywords.r3 - a list of Rebol 3 function names with refinement variations (created by list_keywords.r3)

  * GCP-datatypes.r created from keywords.r3 via create-GCP-keywords.r3

  * GCP-datatypes.r had the following removed...

    - functions? (ending in ? - issue with GCP keywords so create generic rule in template)

    - function names of 1 char

    - operators

    - COMMENT  (rule for this in template)


Some thoughts / caveats?

  * Can imagine some regex won't work to well with utf-8 chars :(

  * See not-working.html for known issues

  * Perhaps don't have keywords defined? (however I think for Stackoverflow questions these will be helpful)


This document is a overview.  See comments in scripts (mentioned above) for most up-to-date info.
