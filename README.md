Story so far:

- Taken the lang-lisp.js and only made slight amendments for Rebol.

- Multi-line string { } only work in simple cases (no embedded {} allowed at moment)

- Literal types need adding (like 25-Dec-2012 10x90)

- Only added few "statements" just to show it works! (see test-rebol.html)

- Would like to build "keywords" straight from Rebol

- In fact it would be nice to build who JS file from Rebol!!!
