Whats needed?:

- Using lang-lisp.js as starting point (recommended by GCP), create Rebol version

- Send back to GCP as patch with test


Story so far:

- Created a lang-rebol.js with only slight amendments to Lisp version

- Multi-line string { } works with caveat must use ^} for embedded closing brace.

- Shebang! line added (as comment)

- Literal types need adding (like 25-Dec-2012 10x90)

- Only added few "statements" just to show it works! (see test-rebol.html)

- Would like to build "statements" straight from Rebol

- In fact it would be nice to build whole JS file from Rebol!!!


To test - clone repo and open the test.html files in web browser.
